## Installation instructions

### Preparation
#### Inline Entity Form
It is recommended to apply a patch for the [Inline Entity Form](https://www.drupal.org/project/inline_entity_form) module:
- Issue: [Entities are not updated during buildEntity() phase](https://www.drupal.org/node/2830829)
- Patch https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/ief_building.patch

#### Pusher
The default method to push new posts to your users is via the _Pusher_ service.
You have to register an account for it here: https://pusher.com/. Please note down 
the App ID, Key and Secret.  
You also need the pusher library. See here for instructions: https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-php

If you are not using a composer workflow, you can download the library here: https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-php/releases.
Use pusher version 3.0.0 or greater.  
Extract it into your libraries folder (`libraries` or `sites/<domain>/libraries`) and rename it to `pusher`.
The library should contain the path `src/Pusher.php`

### Installation
1. Activate the _Liveblog_ and the _Liveblog Pusher_ modules.
    - optionally activate _Liveblog Paragraphs_ for a preconfigured 
     paragraphs integration
2. Navigate to http://example.com/admin/config/content/liveblog

Highlights add a class to the post, according to the selected one, e.g. when you
select _Breaking News_, the class
